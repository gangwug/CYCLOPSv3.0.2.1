## Introduction

CYCLOPS (Cyclic Ordering by Periodic Structure) is a tool designed to reconstruct the temporal ordering of high dimensional 
that is generated by a common periodic process. DetailDescriptions of the CYCLOPS approach can be found online at 
[PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/04/19/1619320114.full)(Anafi R.C. et al., CYCLOPS reveals human transcriptional
rhythms in health and disease. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017. 114(20):5312-5317). The original and in-development version of
CYCLOPS could be found from the GitHub page of Dr. [Ron C. Anafi](https://github.com/ranafi). 

This repository contains the revised CYCLOPS pipleline that was developed to order ~300 human epidermis samples 
(Wu G., et al., Population-level rhythms in human skin with implications for circadian medicine. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018. 115(48):12313-12318). It was furter improved to order human epidermis and dermis samples from different body sites.
